IO completion port for Linux (toy project)

This was a toy project to try re-implementing Windows IO completion port
functionality under Windows and to assess if there is any real performance
benefit to it still left. 

Benchmarking indicated any benefit at all is achievable only in very narrow
class of use cases, and is minor even then, so not worth bothering.
